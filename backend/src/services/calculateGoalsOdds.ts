//to predict a team's goals you will:
//multiply its attack strength by the opponent's defence strength, and by the average number of say home goals(side dependent)
//in the league. for home

//to predict the away side's goals you will do the same multiplication above but multiply by the average number of away goals in the league this time

//now you have each side's expected average/goals in the match

//now you can use the poisson distribution to determine probabilities of a certain number of goals being scored per team

//strategy: based on the team's stats, calculate the teams' average goals as per the previous seasons,
//store the probability for each score in an array, this array is relevant all season long
//to get correct score predictions multiply probabilities for two teams.
